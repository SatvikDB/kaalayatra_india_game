## What is KaalaYatra?

KaalaYatra ("Journey Through Time") is a browser-based educational game built for students aged 10–16. Instead of reading textbooks, players explore ancient Indian civilizations as an interactive adventure — walking through historical cities, talking to NPCs, solving puzzles, and making decisions that change outcomes.

The game aligns with NEP 2020 and NCF 2023 curriculum goals, making humanities learning engaging and memorable.
